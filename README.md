#### Purpose
To have a way to track how plants in personal collection are cared for.

#### New Technologies Explored
- Weater2020 API through [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Weather2020/api/weather)
- [React Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios)

#### Full Stack
- Python - Flask
- PostgresQL
- React - Fetch

#### Challenges
- I was still fairly new to Python when tackling this as my final project. While I was able to get a better grasp on Python during this project, I was not able to fully understand axios. 

#### Best of Project
- I am most proud on understanding Python more. My backend was able to cleanly go through CRUD. I am also proud that I was able to get the Switch routes for most of the views.
